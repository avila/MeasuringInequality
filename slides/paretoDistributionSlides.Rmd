# Pareto Distribution

## Background

- Vilfredo Pareto (1897) presents a versatile functional relation that well describes wealth distribution across countries and centuries. 
- Same concept is applied to several other fields and colloquially called
*Pareto Principle*.
  - 80% of land owned by 20% of individuals (revenue $\sim$ products; sales $\sim$ clients; etc)
- Generally, it follows a *power law probability distribution*, where one measure varies constantly as an exponential of another, independently of initial values.
  - Example: if one increases the side length of a square by $x$, its area increases by $x^2$, independently of initial area of square.

## Functional Form

The **Pareto Distribution** is defined by 
$$f(y, \underline y, \alpha) = \frac{\alpha \underline y^\alpha}
{y^{\alpha+1}} , \quad 0 < \underline y < y$$

and
$$F(y, \underline y, \alpha ) = 1 - \left( \frac{~\underline y~}{y}   \right)^{\alpha} , \quad 0 < \underline y < y$$

where:

- $y$: wealth measure
- $\alpha$: Pareto's $\alpha$ (or *shape*/*slope parameter*)
- $\underline y$: lower bound (or *scale parameter* or *threshhold value*)

## Graphical Visualisation I

\note{

Here we can see how the Probability and Cumulative Distribution looks like.

- Only defined after lowerbound

- very heavy right tail 

- very left dense

\note{\ttfamily{
In order to better visualise this distribution TWO transformations are taken:

1. calculate 1 - CDF\\
2. plot on log-log scale (or log-log the data)\\
\qquad .\\
\qquad .

HERE: lower bound = 1000 \\
\qquad $\alpha$ = Slope in loglog
}}


## Properties 

*Pareto's $\alpha$:*

- Sloppy interpretation: for a percentage increase in $y$, the proportion of *richer* individuals by $\alpha$ percents.
- Higher $\alpha$ values $\Rightarrow$ less inequality.^[for inequality measures satisfying the *Weak Transfers Principle* (Cowell 2011, p. 89).]
- Several inequality indexes can be estimated based on $\alpha$.
  - Example: Gini coefficient: $\frac{1}{2 \alpha - 1}$.

*Possible problems:*

- High flexibility on estimating the lower bound
- Sensibility of $\alpha$ due to choice of the lower bound $\underline y$

- For narrow excerpts of the data other distributions are "just as good"
